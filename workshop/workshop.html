        <p>"I have taken other workshops and learned from other farmer-florists that I admire and love, but Erin is an
            open heart—and that is priceless. This workshop speaks to the heart more than anything else. Thank you for
            sharing your human struggle with us, for teaching us—not only how to grow flowers and the technical side of
            business—but for sharing your fears and your weaknesses and your strengths."</p>
